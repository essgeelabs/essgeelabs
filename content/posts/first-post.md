## Welcome

I've been meaning to put up a website like this for a really long time, but never got around to doing it. While I have by [personal](https://www.sachinganpat.com) and [business](https://www.interxect.com) website, I've never put up a technical one.

The truth is that even with over two decades of experience, I still feel that what I have to offer is not enough. That whatever I say is going to sound stupid or is not valuable. Which is weird because I know many people value my input in things.

[Imposter syndrome](https://www.sachinganpat.com/2019/11/smart-but-not-smart-enough/) is a heck of a thing. 


## What to expect

At the home page says, I'm using this site to document some of the things that I'm learning and experimenting with. I'll also add information that I've found useful in my day-to-day activities as a network and infrastructure engineer/manager. 

Topics in my head:

      - DevOps, DevSecOps and CyberSecurity

      - Network and Infrastructure Architectures

      - Machine Learning and Intelligence Augmentation

      - Electronics and The Internet of Things

      - Web Development and Programming in Python

I expect this to be very broad and varied so the SEO might be shit. But I hope it helps someone.


## Why put up this site?

The main aim of the site is to share my knowledge and help others who are trying to do the same thing I am doing.

But why do this when there are tons of sites out there doing the same?

Because if you're like me, you've found that even going through those sites don't help all the time and you end up figuring out things on your own or by putting the pieces together. Here I hope you find all the pieces in one place.

But more so, I want to hold myself accountable in actually doing the things I put in the list.

I hope you enjoy the journey with me. Reach out to me via my social handles
